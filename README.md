I use UltiSnips to add custom code-snippets. For autocompletion, I use YouCompleteMe.

Special thanks to [Jonas Devlieghere](https://github.com/JDevlieghere) whose YCM config I copied as-it-is from [here](https://jonasdevlieghere.com/a-better-youcompleteme-config/). His flags were just perfect except I added a few -Wnoerrors because the compiler was giving tonne of squiggles for the wrong programming practices I overlook all the time.
